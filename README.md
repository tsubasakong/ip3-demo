IP3 is the foundational infrastructure designed to revolutionize the global intellectual property (IP) management system. Harnessing the power of decentralized technologies, IPillar offers a transformative infrastructure that streamlines the IP licensing process, eliminates traditional agent models, ensures reasonable pricing, and improves value distribution across various IPs. 

IP3 license protocol redefines the IP licensing process by making it faster, more efficient, and accessible to everyone. This License Protocol deprecates the traditional agent model and employs a decentralized on-chain Automated Market Maker (AMM) smart price mechanism, along with community-owned mathematical formulas. By adjusting IP licensing prices based on supply and demand, this protocol ensures a more transparent and fair pricing system for all parties involved. This streamlined process significantly increases IP adaptation and creates motivation for both IP creators and customers.
